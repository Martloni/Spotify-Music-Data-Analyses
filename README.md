# Spotify-Music-Data-Analyses

Spotify is a digital music, podcast and video streaming service that has gained enormous popularity in recent years. It allows people to access millions of songs and other audio content from all over the world in one convenient service. 
<br/><br/>
The data used in these analyses was from two different sources. The top songs from 2010-2019 dataset was from Kaggle and the mood analyses dataset was taken using the spotify API. 
<br/><br/>
This project is separated into three jupyter notebooks:
